			<h3>Learning Reflection</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					I had struggled to understand the benefit/usage of node.js when we
					first learned about it in Week 9.
				</li>
				<li>
					This week 11 assignment using the local server really helped me to
					understand node.js better.
				</li>
				<li>
					I was the driver for the team activity this week, but I felt very
					confused as my group was working on the assignment.
				</li>
				<li>
					We were able to get through a good portion of the assignment, but left
					the rest of the assignment to be completed individually.
				</li>
				<li>
					By working through the assignment and going line-by-line through the
					instructor's example, I felt like I was more fully able to uderstand
					how to use error handling and error objects.
				</li>
				<li>
					I also figured out that my version of the program wasn't working
					because I had my login button as a 'submit' type, instead of a
					standard 'button'. This caused it to not fully process the functions
					for displaying the posts. I was able to figure out this error by
					looking through the instructor solution line-by-line.
