				<li>
					Ajax allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server and
					dynamically update webpages without reloading.
				</li>
				<li>
					Clients request resources from a server, servers send responses back
					to client.
				</li>
				<li>
					Javascript is a client-side language, Ajax allows it to request
					resources from a server.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ajax can be practice with a local development server or a website that
					uses Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
				</li>
				<li>
					Asynchronous means that the program doesn't have to stop and wait for
					the response.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ajax originally sent back XML documents, but JSON is most commonly
					used now.
				</li>
				<li>
					Application programming interfaces (API) are methods that allow
					external access to a program or service.
				</li>
				<li>The fetch API is the standard for requesting and sending data.</li>
				<li>Fetch uses promises to avoid callback issues.</li>
				<li>fetch() has only one mandatory argument, the URL being fetched.</li>
				<li>
					Fetch uses promises, so the catch statement can deal with errors.
				</li>
				<li>
					The response interface for fetch has an ‘ok’ property that is true if
					the response was successful/created.
				</li>
				<li>The redirect() method can be used to redirect to another URL.</li>
				<li>text() method takes a stream of text and returns a promise.</li>
				<li>
					blob() reads a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet.
					The promise resolves with a blob object.
				</li>
				<li>
					JSON is the most common format for AJAX responses. json() transforms a
					stream of JSON into a promise.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can create your own response object using a constructor: const
					response = new Response(“”,{});
				</li>
				<li>
					By providing a Request object you get more control over the request
					being made.
				</li>
				<li>
					There are five commonly used HTTP verbs (methods): GET, POST, PUT,
					PATCH, DELETE
				</li>
				<li>
					HTTP headers pass on additional information about a request or
					response.
				</li>
				<li>AJAX can also be used to send information to a server.</li>
				<li>
					AJAX is a living standard, meaning it is developed in the wild. It can
					and will change as feedback is provided about how it works.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you don’t want to deal with the “wild”, libraries like jQuery can
					handle your AJAX requests.
